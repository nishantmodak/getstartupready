      <h4>How What & Why </h4>

      <p>An individual's career has 3 dimensions - breadth, width and depth. We believe that a startup helps the individual grow in all these 3 ways - by the vastness of the industry / technology, the depth of the knowledge and the never ending challenges.</p>
      
      <p>Startups also are always looking for talented individuals to work with and always find it difficult to fill in positions because of shortage in supply of honed skills. What better than to provide them with required skills and match with passionate talent.</p>
